📌 ASSIGMNET OVERVIEW

This assignment focuses on understanding and applying Oracle Multitenant Architecture concepts. The work involved creating, managing, verifying, and deleting Pluggable Databases (PDBs), as well as configuring database administration tools.

The assignment helped me gain practical experience in Oracle database container management and user administration.


💻 ENVIRONMENT USED 

🗄️ Oracle Database 21c Enterprise Edition
🖥️ SQL*Plus Command Line Tool
📊 Oracle Enterprise Manager Express
🪟 Windows Operating System





🧩 Task 1 – Create a New Pluggable Database

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a new Pluggable Database using the required naming convention and create a user inside it for future class work.

🔎 Step 1: Viewing Existing PDBs

I first checked existing pluggable databases using:

COMMAND: SHOW PDBS
This allowed me to confirm the database environment before creating a new PDB.

🏗️ Step 2: CREATING THE PDB

I created the new pluggable database using the required naming convention:

NAMING CONVENTION:   NDJ_PDB_25273

The database was successfully created and verified.

🔓 Step 3: OPENING THE PDB

The PDB was opened using:
COMMAND: ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE NDJ_PDB_25273 OPEN;

The database is already opened as the screenshort shows and it's in read write mode 



👤 Step 4: CREATING USER INSIDE PDB

I switched to the PDB container and created the required user:
ndjibu_plsqlauca_25273

🔐 Privileges granted:

✔ CONNECT
✔ REOURCE
This user will be used for future practical coursework.

🧩 Task 2 – Create and Delete a Temporary PDB
🎯 OBJECTIVE

Demonstrate understanding of the PDB lifecycle by creating and deleting a temporary pluggable database.

🏗️  1: CREATING TEMPORARY PDB 

The temporary database created was:
ND_TO_DELETE_PDB_25273

The database appeared in MOUNTED state.

⚠️ Step 2: ATTEMPTING TO CLOSE TEMPOPARY PDB

While closing the PDB, the system returned:

🗑️ Step 3: DELETING TEMPORARY PDB

The temporary PDB was deleted using:
COMMAND: DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE ND_TO_DELETE_PDB_25273 INCLUDING DATAFILES;

🧩 Task 3 – Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
❗ IT'S HERE I REAALY GOT STUP EVEN THOUGH I TRIED LOGIN MY REAL CREDENTIALS BUT I COULD STILL LOGIN INTO OEM BUT ACCESSING IT YES I HAVE ACCESSED IT:

⚠️ CHALLENGED FACED 

During this assignment, I experienced several technical challenges including:

1️⃣ 1. Listener Connection Errors

The database initially failed to connect due to service registration issues.

2️⃣ 2. Authentication Problems

Login failures occurred due to incorrect credentials and role requirements.

3️⃣ 3. OEM Access Issues

Oracle Enterprise Manager required correct port configuration and container selection.
